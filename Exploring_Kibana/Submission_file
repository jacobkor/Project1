3. Now that you have a feel for the data, Let's dive a bit deeper. Look at the chart that shows Unique Visitors Vs. Average Bytes.
     - Locate the time frame in the last 7 days with the most amount of bytes (activity).
	 01/30 @ 19:00 had 1 visitor with 15,709 bytes
	 
	 ![alt text]https://github.com/jacobkor/Project1/blob/main/Exploring_Kibana/unique-visitors-vs-activity.png "Unique Visitors Vs. Average Bytes")	

     - In your own words, is there anything that seems potentially strange about this activity?
       looks like somone trying to do somthing not sure what yet but comparing to other data in thie unique visitors vs. avarage bytes there is a lot of bytes for 1 user and this is definatly sespicous.
