Activity File: Kibana Continued

SSH Barrage: 

For this activity, I have created a bash script "while" loop. This will ssh both of the VM's non-stop until CTRL+C is pressed.
This is my script: 

#!/bin/bash
while :
do
    ssh sysadmin@10.0.0.5
  	ssh sysadmin@10.0.0.6
    echo "infinite loops [ hit CTRL+C to stop ]"
done



Activity File:Linux Strees: 

Activity File: wget-DoS

For this activity, I have created another bash script to do the following: It will infinitely wget both WEB VM's and remove the index file downloaded. 

#!/bin/bash
while :
do
    wget 10.0.0.5
    wget 10.0.0.6
    echo "infinite loops [ hit CTRL+C to stop ]"
    rm index.*
done
